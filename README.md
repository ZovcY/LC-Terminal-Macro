# LC-Terminal-Macro
WIP macro for Lethal Company terminal commands

main feature is On-The-Fly (OTF) command keys


Built around AutoHotkey v1.something </br>
Dunno how that interacts with v2
</br></br></br>
Currently only has 0, 1, +, and - bound on the numpad. alongside a script shutdown on F9 and Escape closing guis
</br></br>
Numpad0 is the only OTF key currently bound</br>
Numpad+ toggles edit mode for the OTF key(s)</br>
Numpad- clears saved commands on OTF key(s)</br>
Numpad1 runs the UniversalCodes list</br></br>
... why do github hate line spacing? (nvm, its in markdown. am dumb)
