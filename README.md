# LC-Terminal-Macro
WIP macro for Lethal Company terminal commands

main feature is On-The-Fly (OTF) command keys

Built around AutoHotkey v1.something 
Dunno how that interacts with v2

Currently only has 0, 1, +, and - bound on the numpad. alongside a script shutdown on F9 and escape closing guis

Numpad0 is the only OTF key currently bound
Numpad+ toggles edit mode for the OTF key(s)
Numpad- clears saved commands on OTF key(s)
Numpad1 runs the UniversalCodes list
